Project Title: Sonar Rock vs. Mine Classification Using Logistic Regression
Introduction
In this project, we aim to classify sonar signals as either rocks (R) or mines (M) using logistic regression. Sonar data has been widely used for this purpose due to its applications in underwater navigation and defense.

Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

numpy for numerical operations
pandas for data manipulation
scikit-learn (sklearn) for machine learning algorithms and metrics
Data Collection and Processing
We start by loading the dataset and exploring its structure:

The dataset consists of 208 samples with 60 features each.
Features represent various aspects of sonar signals, and the target variable is categorical (R or M).
Data Exploration
We analyze the dataset to understand its statistical properties and class distribution:

Descriptive statistics like mean, standard deviation, min, and max values of each feature.
Class distribution shows 111 samples of rocks (R) and 97 samples of mines (M).
Data Preparation
Separate the dataset into features (X) and target labels (Y).
Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split to evaluate model performance.
Model Training - Logistic Regression
Train a logistic regression model using the training data (X_train, Y_train).
Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy on both the training and test datasets using accuracy_score.
Results
Accuracy on Training Data: 83.42%
Accuracy on Test Data: 76.19%
Predictive System
Demonstrate how to make predictions on new data:
Define input data representing sonar signal features.
Predict the class (R or M) using the trained logistic regression model.
Print a user-friendly message based on the prediction result.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of logistic regression for classifying sonar signals as rocks or mines with reasonable accuracy. Further improvements could involve exploring other machine learning algorithms or optimizing model parameters.
